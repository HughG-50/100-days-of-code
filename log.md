# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: April 3rd, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Decided to join the 100-days-of-code challenge - started with a [100dayscss](https://100dayscss.com/) challenge

**Thoughts:** Inspired after completing the first version of my first ever website - https://hughgreethead.dev/ and seeing the work of the classmates, (and limited to the house during Covid-19 lockdown) I decided to embark on the 100-days-of-code challenge. 

I setup my Codepen and completed a challenge that focused on SCSS skills, relevant as I'd spent the past week working with CSS to style my portfolio website. One of main challenges of CSS is just knowing how to find what tool/component/attribute to work with. Searching online for specific solutions helps massively.

### Day 1: April 4th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Started building web scraper in Ruby

**Thoughts**: Being able to web scrape effectively has so many use cases and is a fun weekend project. Inspired by my friends desire to be able to copy sports stats cleanly into a spreadsheet, I started to create a web scraper that create a CSV file from the values of the College Football 2019 stats. Most challenging part was getting Nokogiri Ruby Gem library function to parse exactly what I wanted.

### Day 2: April 5th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Completed the implementation of my web scraper

**Thoughts**: Expanded the web scraper project to making a script that scrapes the information from [cryptocurrencyjobs.co](https://cryptocurrencyjobs.co/). A side benefit of the project was that it forces you to get more familiar with using the Google Chrome tools and being able to understand CSS selectors and how others use them in their code.

### Day 3: April 6th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Ruby revision

**Thoughts**: The day was spent going back over all the Ruby concepts I've learnt in the past month since starting the Coder Academy bootcamp in Sydney, Australia. Days like this are not as stimulating but important to help consolidate learnings.

### Day 4: April 7th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Introduction to MVC

**Thoughts**: First time learning the web architecture concept of Model-View-Controller. Also went over and consolidated the concept of Composition vs Inheritance - a good understanding of this very important to MVC.

### Day 5: April 8th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Introduction to Rails Apps - first Rails app made

**Thoughts**: Learnt how to setup new Rails apps, deploy and create new forms. Convention over configuration. Lots of new things to wrap the head around that I'm still figuring out. Need to get comfortable that you aren't going to (and don't need to) understand what exactly everything is doing in a Rails app.

### Day 6: April 9th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Learning about Rails routing, and using REST APIs

**Thoughts**: After struggling for a while to understand APIs, having the concepts of GET, POST, PUT, PATCH and DELETE drilled into me helped massively. Played around with a Rails app learning routing and also had fun making use of different RESTful APIs, using APIs excites me a lot as I've realised its quite simple to use them and they are very powerful.

### Day 7: April 10th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Learnt more about JSON and automating workflow

**Thoughts**: To compliment my newly learnt knowledge about REST APIs, I spent time learning more about the JSON format and how its used in APIs. Also began playing around with automation, inspired by one of the programming youtubers that is quickly becoming my favourite, Kalle Hallden. The shell script automatically creates a new git repo in your desired directory as well as creating a new repo on Github and linking the remote.
