# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: April 3rd, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Decided to join the 100-days-of-code challenge - started with a [100dayscss](https://100dayscss.com/) challenge

**Thoughts:** Inspired after completing the first version of my first ever website - https://hughgreethead.dev/ and seeing the work of the classmates, (and limited to the house during Covid-19 lockdown) I decided to embark on the 100-days-of-code challenge. 

I setup my Codepen and completed a challenge that focused on SCSS skills, relevant as I'd spent the past week working with CSS to style my portfolio website. One of main challenges of CSS is just knowing how to find what tool/component/attribute to work with. Searching online for specific solutions helps massively.

### Day 1: April 4th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Started building web scraper in Ruby

**Thoughts**: Being able to web scrape effectively has so many use cases and is a fun weekend project. Inspired by my friends desire to be able to copy sports stats cleanly into a spreadsheet, I started to create a web scraper that create a CSV file from the values of the College Football 2019 stats. Most challenging part was getting Nokogiri Ruby Gem library function to parse exactly what I wanted.

### Day 2: April 5th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Completed the implementation of my web scraper

**Thoughts**: Expanded the web scraper project to making a script that scrapes the information from [cryptocurrencyjobs.co](https://cryptocurrencyjobs.co/). A side benefit of the project was that it forces you to get more familiar with using the Google Chrome tools and being able to understand CSS selectors and how others use them in their code.

### Day 3: April 6th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Ruby revision

**Thoughts**: The day was spent going back over all the Ruby concepts I've learnt in the past month since starting the Coder Academy bootcamp in Sydney, Australia. Days like this are not as stimulating but important to help consolidate learnings.

### Day 4: April 7th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Introduction to MVC

**Thoughts**: First time learning the web architecture concept of Model-View-Controller. Also went over and consolidated the concept of Composition vs Inheritance - a good understanding of this very important to MVC.

### Day 5: April 8th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Introduction to Rails Apps - first Rails app made

**Thoughts**: Learnt how to setup new Rails apps, deploy and create new forms. Convention over configuration. Lots of new things to wrap the head around that I'm still figuring out. Need to get comfortable that you aren't going to (and don't need to) understand what exactly everything is doing in a Rails app.

### Day 6: April 9th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Learning about Rails routing, and using REST APIs

**Thoughts**: After struggling for a while to understand APIs, having the concepts of GET, POST, PUT, PATCH and DELETE drilled into me helped massively. Played around with a Rails app learning routing and also had fun making use of different RESTful APIs, using APIs excites me a lot as I've realised its quite simple to use them and they are very powerful.

### Day 7: April 10th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Continued working on first Rails App and automation

**Thoughts**: To compliment my newly learnt knowledge about REST APIs, I spent time learning more about the JSON format and how its used in APIs. Also began playing around with automation, inspired by one of the programming youtubers that is quickly becoming my favourite, Kalle Hallden. The shell script automatically creates a new git repo in your desired directory as well as creating a new repo on Github and linking the remote.

### Day 8: April 11th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Continued working on first Rails App

**Thoughts**: Continued working on my first Rails blog app. Running into lots of roadblocks with routing errors and general unfamiliarity/newness to Rails. Very frustrating, but I think switching over to a Rails project that interests me more it will help a lot - e.g. building a cryptocurrency portfolio app. All part of the process.

### Day 9: April 12th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Started building Cryptocurrency Portfolio Tracker in Rails

**Thoughts**: Decided that best way to learn some Rails would be to try and follow a tutorial on building something that interests me. Will modify and expand upon it at a later date. Having fun putting this together so far - following along here https://zayne.io/articles/build-a-cryptocurrency-portfolio-calculator

### Day 10: April 13th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Continued building out the crypto portfolio tracker. 

**Thoughts**: Spent most of today's coding playing around with the [Coinmarketcap API](https://coinmarketcap.com/api/documentation/v1/), feeling a lot more comfortable now with RESTful APIs and authentication, will be cool once I finally get this working nicely in an app.

### Day 14: April 17th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Putting MVC together

**Thoughts**: Finished off putting together my first Rails app with complete MVC from scratch. It doesn't do much but I'm starting to feel like I'm getting a good grasp on the concepts, Rails is nice.

### Day 15: April 18th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Fixed bugs in Project Automation Initialization and learned more about env variables

**Thoughts**: Fixed bugs in my [shell scripting automation project](https://github.com/KalleHallden/ProjectInitializationAutomation) that I forked from Kalle Hallden. Has definitely given me a greater understanding of env variables and shell scripting. Also spent time learning about different ways I could store my API keys for my crypto portfolio tracker app.

### Day 16: April 19th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Completed Backend (Model and Controller) for cryptocurrency portfolio app

**Thoughts**: Rewarding day, managed to get the Coinmarketcap API working correctly with my API key stored safely in an environment variable, setup in a local_env.yml file in my Rails app - a blocker that I overcame. Now that the backend is set, my work now moves to building out all of the front-end. Using React components, but still very new to React so will take it step-by-step.

### Day 20: April 23rd, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Further progress with database relationships

**Thoughts**: Implementation of database normalization. Join tables and tables with polymorphic relationships were built. Cool to see how it is visualised and is important to organise our database structures so we can maintain favourable time complexity and useful structure.

### Day 27: April 30th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Integrating payments with Stripe API

**Thoughts**: Very fun day learning how to integrate Credit Card payments into a Rails app with the Stripe API. The Stripe documentation is the gold standard for quality, making use of the API smooth and easy. Stripe will be fun to dive deeper into and play around with.

**Link(s) to work**: [Snake Store App](https://github.com/HughG-50/rails-snakebay)

### Day 28: May 1st, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Consolidating database knowledge

**Thoughts**: Started a simple project to revise and go over all of the Rails topics learnt in the past few weeks, building up a simple book exchange website from scratch. Spent more time focused on consolidating database relationship knowledge and how to think about their design. I am realising that databases are such a broad topic on their own and is going to take a lot of effort to get comfortable with, its another topic that goes very deep and you also need to figure out to what extent you are ok with what you know for what is needed to make a web application.

### Day 29: May 2nd, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Revising and getting better at db relations, setting up models

**Thoughts**: Spent majority of the time mapping out the entities for my book exchange further and their relations. Generated all of the necessary Models.

### Day 30: May 3rd, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Building out MVC for practice Rails application

**Thoughts**: Consolidating a lot of the information that has been thrown at me in the last couple of weeks regarding Rails and web application frameworks. Getting stuck in particular when it comes manipulating/using data from within related tables - adds that extra layer of complexity that makes it less natural for me. Persistence and practice I'll feel more comfortable with it.

**Link(s) to work**: [Git Collaboration](https://github.com/HughG-50/git-collaboration-practice)

### Day 33: May 6th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Start of Rails Hackathon

**Thoughts**: Less hands on coding and more design focus. GitHot is a website that tracks the top 10 most popular repositories created in the past week on Github. Design session focus on user stories, entity planning, Github API research and ER Diagram creation.

### Day 34: May 7th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Rails Hackathon Continued

**Thoughts**: Created the entire Rails framework today. I focused on the Github Search API initially, creating the correct query string for what we wanted to do as well as correct parsing. Focus was on generating the right models and controllers needed, with basic elements within the Views.

### Day 35: May 8th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Rails Hackathon Conclusion

**Thoughts**: Very happy with the final result. A well functioning website with consistent styling throughout, achieved mostly through the use of Bootstrap, allowing for user friendly and appealing interfaces to be generated quickly within the time restraints of the hackathon. The afternoon was spent on deployment to Heroku - some learning curve still to be had there, particularly if the application requires some more complex processes.

### Day 36: May 9th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Raspberry pi NAS built

**Thoughts**: A bit of a different flavour to a weekend project. Built a Network Attached Storage (NAS) device using 2, 2TB hard drives and a raspberry pi 4. It runs Raid 1, providing a safe and secure backup drive for all of my files. Also great way to spend some time in Linux - using SSH and Vim.

### Day 37: May 10th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Two way marketplace research

**Thoughts**: Researching for my Coder Academy marketplace project that is to be built in Rails. Planning to build a slightly simplified version of https://localbitcoins.com, the biggest issue preventing complete replication within the timeframe would be safely imlementing the escrow functionality of the website (they host their own Bitcoin wallets for payment escrow). Otherwise all of the web application functionality seems fairly replicable.
