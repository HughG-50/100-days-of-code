# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: April 3rd, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Decided to join the 100-days-of-code challenge - started with a [100dayscss](https://100dayscss.com/) challenge

**Thoughts:** Inspired after completing the first version of my first ever website - https://hughgreethead.dev/ and seeing the work of the classmates, (and limited to the house during Covid-19 lockdown) I decided to embark on the 100-days-of-code challenge. 

I setup my Codepen and completed a challenge that focused on SCSS skills, relevant as I'd spent the past week working with CSS to style my portfolio website. One of main challenges of CSS is just knowing how to find what tool/component/attribute to work with. Searching online for specific solutions helps massively.

### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 2)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
